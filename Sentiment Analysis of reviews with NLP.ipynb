    "The task at hand is to design a system that can take a set of customer reviews of a product and give a summary of the main features and their associated positive and negative sentiments. This will give a buyer useful granulated information when buying a product, compared to the usual five-star rating, as they can focus on the features that they are looking for in a product. Below is what the output will look like."

    "There are 17 files of reviews and review sentences across three data sets from the University of Chicago database. These were taken from Amazon and annotated by Bing Liu for his work in aspect extraction (Hu and Liu., 2004). Two of these have detailed annotations including comparison sentence, [cc] and pronoun resolution [p]. The third dataset has simple tags consisting of just the feature and a sentiment tag up from -3 to +3 (excluding 0) like the other two do. There are some other differences between the datasets, such as the lower-case function and, as shown below. The review titles in the 5-product review set do contain features and sentiments, but these are not labelled, so I will not include them as part of the data I ingest.\n"

    "I will use four of the product files containing 2,057 sentences out of the 10,293 total, approximately 20% as my test set. The remaining 13 product files will be used in various ways as training data.\n",
    "Firstly, the data will be ingested, and put into a list of [“sentence”, “sentiment tag”, [features]] format lists for each file. Then, various pre-processing steps will be done on each sentence. These new sentences will be saved into a dictionary, with the original sentence as the key for easy access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each feature in the reviews has an individual sentiment tag. For sentiment analysis, I am going to assign each sentence either a positive or negative sentiment. Breaking down the sentence into individual parts for each feature is not a realistic process, as they are often intertwined, and using incomplete sentences in the summary would not give the buyer a good user experience. For this reason, I am going to sum the tags and then assign a positive, neutral, or negative tag. The neutral tag is not ideal, as these will not be used in training of the sentiment classifier, but as shown below they make up less than 1% of the sentences."

    "### Part 2: Data pre-processing\n",
    "The data sets have already been pre-processed, but in different ways, which needs to be considered. The sentences will be tokenized to break them down into lexemes. This is the process of demarcating the string into a list of tokens (Webster and Kit., 1992). This will mostly involve splitting by whitespace for the English language, but clitics will also be split out, as they represent words (Crystal 1980).\n",
    "\n",
    "Two datasets have already been tokenized, which means the enclitics such as ‘m and n’t have been split from their host words. These need to be corrected to their true word forms. Manual rules will be put in place to make these corrections (“n’t” to “not”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of speech tagging will then be applied. This is the process whereby each word in a sentence is assigned a PoS tag (Jurafsky and Martin., 2020). This is done with trained models that use the previous words tags, as well as the words themselves to generate the most probable tag for the current word. The Penn Treebank tag set (Marcus et al., 1993) is used by the NLTK package (Bird et al., 2009). The NLTK PoS tagger uses an averaged perceptron tagger trained on the Wall Street Journal corpus (Paul and Baker., 1992).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each token will be lemmatized. This is the process by which each word is reduced to its root or lemma by removing inflectional endings. This also has to be done as two of the datasets have had the annotations lemmatised, e.g. “headphone[-3]##you 're going to need to buy new headphones.” The annotated features will be lemmatised, to ensure that the extracted features match the annotated ones which represent the ground truth. In some cases, such as the example sentence above, will make the summary less readable for the user, as the features will not be in their usual form. For a production model this would either not be applied and processes such as fuzzy matching between lexically similar words (Kalyanathaya et al., 2019) would be used to merge features like headphone (“this came with a broken headphone”) and headphones, with the main word used in the summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any tokens that are or contain punctuation or numbers will then be stripped out. This removes the standard punctuation tokens such as full stops and commas. But will also remove website addresses, which are present in the datasets. The hyphen will be left in, as this can be used in valid words such as “pre-processing”, and is present in some of the feature tags, such as “t-mobile”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, stop words will be stripped out. The are words such as “the” and “is” that are insignificant on their own, and link words in the sentence together (Ullman 2011). NLTK has a predefined stop word list of 179 words that I will use."

    "### Part 3: Feature extraction:\n",
    "The Apriori algorithm (Agarwal and Srikant., 1994) will be the starting point for my feature extraction process. This algorithm finds items in a database of sets of items that frequently occur together (above a specified threshold.). It does this by repeated iterations over the database, finding first individual frequently occurring items, and then pairs of these items, and so on. The output is a list of the features that frequently occur together. The “items” in the sets are the nouns in the sentences. This means that the features that are nouns, and noun phrases will be found. After testing various support levels, I find 1% to be the most effective, so the feature, or set of features must appear in at least 1% of the sentences of that product file.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the Apriori algorithm is done, we are left with sets of tokens e.g. {A, B, C}. The algorithm does not consider the order or how close together they are. For this reason, each permutation of the set is checked. If the words appear in that precise order in at least two sentences in the product file, then the feature is kept. If not, it is pruned. This compactness pruning is like that of Minqing and Hu. (2004). Rather than giving a maximum gap of three as they did, I require an exact match, as the maximum gap could allow two features commonly mentioned together to be accidentally merged.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Apriori algorithm gives all the subsets of a set as features (for instance life and battery will both be features if “battery life” is, these redundant features need to be pruned, unless they occur independently of the superset. This is done with pure support pruning (Hu and Liu 2004). The p-support of a feature is the number of times that the feature appears in a sentence that do not include the superset feature that includes the feature. After trying p-supports of 2, 3 and 4, I found 3 to be the most effective in terms of F1 improvement. As with compactness pruning there is a trade-off. With a higher p-support, we are more certain of a feature, which increases precision, but low frequency features may be cut, which lowers recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the main features have been extracted and pruned, we turn to the infrequent features. For this I used a 6,700-word adjective list. This is an opinion lexicon built by Hu and Liu from their years of research in the field. I will search through the sentences for nouns, that have not already been pruned in previous stages. If there is an adjective in the adjective list adjacent to it, then this feature will be added to the list of infrequent features. This covers the two common uses of adjectives next to a subject. For example, “this is a great car” or “the car is great” (“is” is a stop word, so would have been removed).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is like the semantic based refinement done by Chinh-Ping (2009) where the extracted features were checked by ensuring that a percentage of the occurrences of that feature were near to an adjective, using a fixed adjective seed list. I did not do this on the main set of extracted features, as it is too specific a requirement. A better way would be to use set of syntactic rules as Qie et al. (2011) did to ensure that the statistically extracted features are syntactically relevant and linked to opinions and not just high frequency nouns/noun phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "I implemented a basic “excluded list” to exclude commonly occurring nouns that would never be features, such as “I” and temporal nouns such as “day”, “month” and “year”. An extended exclusion list was added to this as part of the final stage of the feature extraction training. All the infrequent features that were found to not be annotated features were listed, and I then manually went through the list, removing words that looked like they could be plausible aspects for a product. Using this extended list across the thirteen training products results in lower recall, as some annotated features were then excluded when, but the raised precision more than accounted for this, giving a total gain of 2.5% to the average F1 score across the products. For a review summary, readers will mostly be interested in the top features, so excluding some infrequent features should not take away from the overall experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a table of the results of the feature extraction. I used distinct precision (correctly extracted features[TP] / all extracted features[TP+FP]) and recall (correctly extracted features[TP]/all annotated features[TP+FN]). Using the proposed method of a weighted precision and recall (Liu 2015), so a higher frequency feature is given more weight, improves the F1 score across all products, showing that most of the main features are being identified, and the infrequent ones are more likely to be missed."

    "### Part 4: Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "For the training of the sentiment analysis (SA), I am only going to use the positive and negative tagged sentences. That is because the “Neutral” sentences are of negligible number and the “None” tagged no-feature sentences are not neutral in sentiment, they just don’t convey an opinion about a particular feature. See below for examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Sentence | Would be classified as |\n",
    "| :- | :-: |\n",
    "| ##We hated that thing! | Negative |\n",
    "| ##My daughter is now 2 and 1/2, and I am still enjoying this product. | Positive |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main approaches to SA are lexicon based and machine learning with bag of word based machine learning models. The machine learning methods generally outperform lexicon-based approaches (Dhaoui et al., 2017). Lexical methods have also proved incredibly effective however (Hu and Liu., 2004). However, it has also been shown that a hybrid lexical approach can be more effective than a standalone bag of words with (ML Nasim et al., 2017), so both methods have their strengths, as BoW methods don’t take word order into account for instance. I will compare the two main methods to find the one that performs optimally with this dataset to use in my final pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my machine learning approach, I will use a support vector classifier (Noble 2006). These has been shown to be very effective in SA compared to other methods. (Zahoor, Bawany and Hamid., 2020). An SVC identifies a hyperplane that maximally separates the sentences into two classes, positive and negative. It uses a soft margin, which allows for outliers to be on the wrong side of the hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sentence will be vectorised using the words in the training data. Instead of using the frequency of the words in each sentence the presence of the word will be used. This has been shown to be more effective than frequency in SA (Pang and Lee 2002). Not all words will be used however, infrequent words and high frequency words will be discarded, as the information gain from these is not significant and feature reduction has been shown to improve performance with SVCs in SA (Kim et al., 2005).\n",
    "Negation handling will also be done, using the technique of Utkarsh Lal (2022), which was shown to improve accuracy in SA. This is the process whereby a word has its reversed by a negator that proceeds it. Any word following a negator will either be changed to its antonym or removed. I will also remove the features from the sentence, as want to analyse the opinion of the feature, and not the feature itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lexicon approach will use several word lexicons, using the Stanford 2000s lexicons (Hamilton 2016) for adjectives and the top 5,000 common words. Word lexicons will also be used for verbs and word modifiers (e.g., “very” and “mildly”). These amplifiers and downtowners were compiled and assigned values by Taboada et al (2011). There will several stages to this approach. Firstly, as with the machine learning approach, any identified features will be stripped out. Then each word will be assigned a sentiment score from the lexicons. The modifiers will then be used to multiply the word in front of them. Lastly, negation handling will be applied, by using a window of the three words. This is an alternative to just applying negation the next word, as done by Qiu et al. (2011). I found a three-word window to be more effective than five in pretesting. Any words in that window will have their sentiment score multiplied by -1, reversing the polarity. This is switch negation (Sauri 2008). These scores will then be summed and any sentence with a score of 0 or above will be assigned a positive sentiment, negative if not.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rule will be applied however to override this score in one situation. If the word neither is present, this will automatically be assigned a negative tag. This “blind negation” proposed by Palanisamy et al. (2013) was 100% successful in the seven cases it came up in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning approach did fair slightly better, as expected, with about 6% higher accuracy in the pre training and pre-test stages. For this reason, I will use the SVC in my NLP pipeline.\n",

    "Some polar opinions are not expressed lexically (Wiegand et al., 2010), instead they are expressed in a way that needs real world knowledge (e.g., “after a day I wanted to throw the radio out of the window” needs real world knowledge, as no words have a distinct polar sentiment on their own). This is more common with negative opinions and could be the reason that both my lexical and ML SA classifiers had a much lower precision and recall for the negative sentences. This is also clear when looking at the confusion matrix (Stephen 1997), as there is a large proportion of false positives compared to false negatives."

    "From a qualitative point of view multi word features were picked up well, for example “LCD screen”, “Photo quality” and battery life for the Canon camera. The summary reads well, and most of the sentences make sense in context. There are many where a feature is mentioned, but not the focal point of the sentence, however. A more syntactic based approach would help improve this."
